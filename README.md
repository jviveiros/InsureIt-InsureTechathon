Hackathon organized by ADCAT HDFC Life on - (use cases) [Benefit to Increase Insurance Process.]
1. Gamification
2. Get the best deal!
3. Risk Assessment
4. Educating Customers.

InsureIT was under the classification of Gamification, Risk Assessment and Get the best deals.

InsureIT asks for your mobile number and it crawls user's info using TrueCaller API, user's info
including Name, Gender, Email, and Location. InsureIT's main aim is to get very less info from a user
and could help with possible benefits for Insurance Policies.

After asking mobile number, InsureIT start's its Gamification process, Game on Insurance. InsureIT will provide you
with an initial amount of Rs. 10000 and will ask you to either enroll in policy coverage or not.
Currently targeting House Insurance and Vehicle Insurance. As soon as a user starts its process of Gamification,
his ultimate goal is to play in such a way that he has a maximum number of savings claiming the max possibility of policies. As per his/her crawled data, InsureIT figures out the location of that person. As a rule of a game, it will ensure you
to choose Coverage, but it depends on you, how you want to start with your coverage or no coverage.

Hence your figure out your coverage, it will take you to Spin Wheel. It will decide your luck, luck in the sense
it could be anything that could happen in your life, so we decide to have a spin wheel, luck part game.
Hence spin wheel, while spinning can let you earn money as well as can make you bankrupt.
Hence our mail goal is to provide you understanding, example, you spun the wheel, it got stuck at, your house is on fire
hence you lost money. If you would have taken insurance, most of the amount would have been covered, but
if you don't have any coverage of your house, you will lose amount, hence making you even bankrupt.

On each spin of a wheel, we have decided to provide you TIPs, hence to aware you regarding insurance and policies.
After the spin, wheel has been done and 5 chances are over, leaderboard would be generated stating who is the best 
policy player, hence the best one would get some discount on policy.

After he gets over with Gamification process, we hear with best deals related to policies which are feasible to you as per InsureIT study.
InsureIT can figure out your age and professional work experience and let you know your approximate income, hence helping more accurately to figure out best policy applies to you.(Future perspective)
